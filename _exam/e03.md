## Take-home final exam

* As per the Chancellor's recommendations, we will not have an in person final exam. Instead the final will be a take home exam (open book and open notes), administered through gradescope. You may not consult any online resources such as stack overflow or Google. You may only consult the c++ online documentation on this link:[http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/).

* Please note that although the final exam is open book and open notes, you MAY NOT collaborate with each other. If we find evidence of cheating, we will report you to the office of academic integrity and you will receive an F in the course. Students who offer help on the exam will be held equally responsible as those soliciting help.

## Data and Time

The take-home final will be released on Tuesday (March 17) at 4pm. You will have time to complete it until Wednesday (March 18) at 7pm. As such the final should not take more than 3 hours to complete, but we are giving you extra time because you may have other exams during that time.
