## Designing nested loops
* When do we need a loop?
* When do we need a nested loop?
* Checking for limits
* Practice with ASCII art (also topic of lab02)

## Three key aspects of functions
* Declaration (what are the inputs, outputs?)
* Definition  (actual code for achieving the desired behavior)
* Function call (using function)

## C++ Memory Model
* Program layout in memory: text, global data , heap and stack
* The stack and its purpose
* Global vs. local variables

**Math Puzzle**
One of the powers of computing is being able to do a brute-force search for a solution to a problem. Trial and error works just fine for some problems. In fact, computers can be especially good at such problems. Consider this:

Horses cost $10, pigs cost $3, and rabbits are only $0.50. A farmer buys 100 animals for $100, How many of each animal did he buy?  

Write a program to do this.
